##I have updated the submission for algaeClassify v2.0.2 on 12/18/2023 based on errors flagged by Dr. Ripley and the CRAN review team.

#I was not able to reproduce the decribed error in the genus_search_itis function. I believe the error may have occurred 
due to a temporary outage in the ITIS website (www.itis.gov), which is maintained by the U.S. government.
#To prevent this behavior, I have modified all functions that query the ITIS database (genus_search_itis, species_search_itis, and itis_search_df).
All functions now first check whether the itis website is up. If not, they return a warning and a data.frame populated with NAs. This behavior will help
users to avoid breaking their own code when the itis website is temporarily down.
#I have re-built and tested the revised version (v2.0.2).

## Test environments
* local windows 10 environment, R 4.3.1
* ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC, R-release 4.3.1
* Fedora Linux, Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC
* Mac OSX
* winbuilder, R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt), using platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit)

## R CMD check results
Below, I have listed all notes generated by R CMD check as well as the devtools functions check_win_devel, check_win_release, check_mac_release, and check_rhub. My responses are listed below each note, beginning with '-'.
