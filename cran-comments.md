##I have updated the submission for algaeClassify v2.0.1 on 11/20/2023 based on prechecks from the initial CRAN review.

## Test environments
* local windows 10 environment, R 4.3.1
* ubuntu 20.04 (on r_hub), R-release 4.3.1
* Fedora Linux (on r_hub), R-devel, clang, gfortran
* Mac OSX
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
- I have listed all notes generated by R CMD check as well as the devtools functions check_win_devel, check_win_release, check_mac_release, and check_rhub. My responses are listed below each note, beginning with '-'.

I believe some of the remaining notes are known bugs associated with rhub and other tools used for checking packages, which I cannot resolve. None of the remaining notes indicate problems with my code on any of the tested platforms.

##R CMD check results algaeClassify 2.0.1 
	 
1) checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  Initiating curl with CURL_SSL_BACKEND: openssl
  
  -I believe that this is an issue with curl rather than algaeClassify. As long as the user is set up to use curl this note should not create a problem.

##Devtools functions check_win_devel, check_win_release, check_mac_release, and check_rhub
#NOTES:

1) Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  GNRS (30:42)
  ITIS (33:19)
  ritis (33:65)
  taxize (30:78)
  
- These are all acronyms for online databases or names of r package functions,
  and are all correctly spelled.

2) Initiating curl with CURL_SSL_BACKEND: openssl

-I believe that this is an issue with curl rather than algaeClassify. As long as the user is set up to use curl this note should not create a problem.
	
3) Skipping checking HTML validation: no command 'tidy' found

-This appears to be an issue with the test system used by Rhub, rather than a
problem with the package code itself. This issue has been flagged on github as a
general issue encountered by multiple packages.

4) Found the following files/directories:
  ''NULL''
  
 -This appears to be an issue with the Rhub package, not algaeClassify. See https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/560.

5)* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
  
 -This appears to be a known issue with the Rhub pacakge, rather than algaeClassify. See
 https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503.
