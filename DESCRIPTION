Description: Functions that facilitate the use of accepted taxonomic nomenclature, collection of
	functional trait data, and assignment of functional group classifications to phytoplankton
	species. Possible classifications include Morpho-functional group (MFG; Salmaso et al. 2015 
	<doi:10.1111/fwb.12520>) and CSR (Reynolds 1988; Functional morphology and the 
	adaptive strategies of phytoplankton. In C.D. Sandgren (ed). Growth and reproductive 
	strategies of freshwater phytoplankton, 388-433. Cambridge University Press, New York). 
	Versions 2.0.0 and later includes new functions for querying the 
	algaebase online taxonomic database (www.algaebase.org), however these functions require
	a valid API key that must be acquired from the algaebase admin. 
	Note that none of the algaeClassify authors are affiliated with algaebase in any way. Taxonomic 
	namse can also be checked against a variety of taxonomic databases using 
	the geographic name resolution service (GNRS) via wrapper functions for the taxize package, 
	with convenient output format and unlikely names for phytoplankton taxa removed. In addition,
	currently accepted and outdated synonyms, and higher taxonomy, can be extracted for lists of 
	species from the ITIS database using wrapper functions for the ritis package.
	The algaeClassify package is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of 
	Storms on freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB 
    (Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for
	Synthesis and Analysis, with data and other support provided by members of GLEON 
	(Global Lake Ecology Observation Network). This software package has been approved as an official
	U.S. Geological Survey software release in accordance with Department of Interior fundamental 
	science practices.
